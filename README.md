# open-cv
This repo started off as a collection of code for basics of open cv as taught by the kind folks at free code camp comprising small notes and edits by yours truly but I quickly realised that most of the advanced features relied heavily on neural networks. I wasn't really comfortable just using code without knowing what was happening in the black box, so I started with other resources, I'll be linking them here as I learn.
